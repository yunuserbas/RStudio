# We’ve included two small unsorted datasets named dataset_one and dataset_two.
# We’ve also included, as a comment, the sorted version of the first dataset.
# By looking at sorted version of dataset_one, find the second quartile of the dataset and store it in a variable named dataset_one_q2.

dataset_one <- c(50, 10, 4, -3, 4, -20, 2) # sorted dataset_one: [-20, -3, 2, 4, 4, 10, 50]

dataset_two <- c(24, 20, 1, 45, -15, 40) # sorted dataset_two: -15, 1, 20, 24, 40, 45

# define the second quartile of both datasets here:

dataset_one_q2 <- 4

dataset_two_q2 <- 22

# define the first and third quartile of both datasets here:

dataset_one_q1 <- -3

dataset_one_q3 <- 10

dataset_two_q1 <- 1

dataset_two_q3 <- 40

# Create a variable named dataset_one_q1 and set it equal to the first quartile of dataset one. This time, use the second method of finding quartiles.

dataset_one_q1 <- -0.5
