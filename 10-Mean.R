# In this exercise, you will use R to find the average age of the first four authors in Le Mondeâ€™s top 100 books.

# 29, 49, 42, 43

# Add the values together, and set total equal to the answer. Print total.

total <- 29 + 49 + 42 + 43
print(total)


# Divide total by the number of values in the dataset, and set mean_value to the answer.
# Print mean_value. Keep that number in your head as you progress through the lesson.

mean_value <- total / 4
print(mean_value)
